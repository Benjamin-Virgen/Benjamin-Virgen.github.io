    <p>If you haven't been living in an elderly woman's ceiling unbeknownst to her, then you have probably watched or heard of the award-winning animated Pixar film, <em>Ratatouille.</em></p> <br>
    <p>A charming film that touched the hearts of many, <em>Ratatouille</em> quickly became one of the most beloved films within Pixar's repertoire. It is packed full of flavor: from powerful emotion, 
      to amazing comedy, and a heartfelt message: we are all capable of seeing victory, despite being from different backgrounds that may restrict our opportunity. </p>

  <p>The movie itself follows a simple plot: A talented, inventive Rat, who we and his family know as <strong>Remy</strong>, possesses a unique ability that grants him above-average smelling. This, of course, is extremely 
    useful in the culinary field, which Remy strives to pursue. Coincidentally, the rat who yearns to be a professional chef comes to the realization that he finds himself in the heart of Paris, near
    the famed restaurant, Gusteau's, which was owned by the now deceased, world-renowned French chef, Gusteau. He is famous for his motivational phrase: "Anyone can cook."<br> <br> <br>
    Remy encounters numerous challenges on his way to being a renowned chef, from rampaging grandmothers to suspicious, greedy chefs. All of the while, our rat protagonist hides himself in a human's 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef%27s_uniform" target="_blank">toque</a>
    This human, of course, is our other protagonist, <strong>Linguini</strong>, an awkward human that works at Gusteau's restaurant. He quickly rises to fame as a "skilled" chef, who in reality is being controlled by Remy, as if the rat was 
    playing a human simulator; 
    the question of "who should get credit?" is constantly raised throughout the film.
    The hardship Remy endures allows him to learn valuable lessons that guide him towards opening his own restaurant by the end of the movie: <em>La Ratatouille.</em> One important example would be, by the
    climax of the film, when Remy realizes that his bond with family has been completely overshadowed by the attention and satisfaction his career gave him. This gave him an amazing opportunity to go 
    back to his roots, and make room for his rat relatives in the face of growing power and freedom. As a result, his colony become employees at his new restaurant, and helped him greatly in the process of cooking
  a scrumptious dish (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille" target="_blank">ratatouille</a>) to impress an arrogant critic, known as Anton Ego.</p>

    <p>Overall, this film deserves the constant praise it receives, as it transforms the genre of animation into something completely stunning. Any audience can enjoy the movie; it succeeds in being relatable
    and fun. It takes a relatively easy-to-make progression and cranks the entertainment value to 100. It also contains one of the most impactful scenes within all of Pixar, that being the scene with
    food critic Anton Ego seemingly transported back to his childhood the moment the Remy's food, ratatouille, touched his taste buds. Many adults who have seen the movie found this scene to be special,
    as it also took them back to childhood, back when their parents were in charge and bombarded them with love and care. If you have been hesitant to indulge in <em>Ratatouille</em>, know is the time to 
    witness its beauty. Whenever you're available, take an hour out of the day and play the film. <br> <br> <br>
    
    -For the rest of your days, whenever you're feeling worthless or out of luck, you'll always remember the wise words of Gusteau: "Anyone can cook!"
