    <p>If you haven't been living in an elderly woman's ceiling unbeknownst to her, then you have probably watched or heard of the award-winning animated Pixar film, <em>Ratatouille.</em></p> <br>
    <p>A charming film that touched the hearts of many, <em>Ratatouille</em> quickly became one of the most beloved films within Pixar's repertoire. It is packed full of flavor: from powerful emotion, 
      to amazing comedy, and a heartfelt message: we are all capable of seeing victory, despite being from different backgrounds that may restrict our opportunity. </p>
  
  <h2 style="color:#e81900">Entree</h2>
  <p>The movie itself follows a simple plot: A talented, inventive Rat, who we and his family know as Remy, possesses a unique ability that grants him above-average smelling. This, of course, is extremely 
    useful in the cullinary field, which Remy strives to pursue. Coincidentally, the rat who yearns to be a professional chef comes to the realization that he finds himself in the heart of Paris, near
    the famed restaurant, Gusteau's, which was owned by the now deceased, world-renowned French chef, Gusteau. He is famous for his motivational phrase: "Anyone can cook."<br> <br> <br>
    Remy encounters numerous challenges on his way to being a renowned chef, from rampaging grandmothers to suspicious, greedy chefs. All of the while, our rat protagonist hides himself in a human's

    This human, of course, is our other protagonist, Linguini, an awkward human that works at Gusteau's restaurant. He quickly rises to fame as a "skilled" chef, who in reality is being controlled by Remy, as if the rat was playing a human simulator; 
    the question of "who should get credit?" is constantly raised throughout the film.
    The hardship Remy endures allows him to learn valuable lessons that guide him towards opening his own restaurant by the end of the film: <em>La Ratatouille.</em> One important example would be, by the
    climax of the film, when Remy realizes that his bond with family has been completely overshadowed by the attention and satistfaction his career gave him. This gave him an amazing opportunity to go 
    back to his roots, and make room for his rat relatives in the face of growing power and freedom. </p>
